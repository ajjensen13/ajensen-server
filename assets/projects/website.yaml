  title: Reverse Proxy
  content_markdown: |+
    I created a simple reverse proxy application that allows me
    to easily route traffic to different Kubernetes services.

    It was relatively straight-forward to implement using the
    [httputils](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil?tab=doc#ReverseProxy) package
    from the golang standard library.

    I decided to develop a custom implementation rather than using
    a standard nginx image for a few reasons:

    1. I wanted a simple and straight-forward Go application to test my TeamCity build agents with.
    2. I plan to implement an adaptive Single-Page-App server that uses machine learning to push
    assets to clients. I want to detect what files to push by monitoring requests that happen within
    a single HTTP keep-alive connection. I'll likely add this tracking to the reverse-proxy layer.
